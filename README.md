The Perl Foundation is preparing an application
for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
2021.

This page lists project ideas for Perl, Raku and its related projects.


## Project Ideas

Divided by language, here they are

### Raku

- [libgccjit backend for MoarVM's Just In Time compiler](raku/libccjig-backend.md),
  proposed by Stefan Seifert.
- [GTK4 bindings for Raku](raku/gtk-4 bindings.md), proposed by
  Richard Hainsworth.

## How to participate

Each project should idea lists the mentors with their contact information at the end.


## General information on the initiative

Google offers some very good documentation for Summer of Code. If you haven't already you should really
[head over to it](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Make sure you don't miss

- [How it works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)
- the [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)
- and the [Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)


## Contact the Raku community

In general the Raku community is most active on IRC. Just drop by on the
[#raku](https://webchat.freenode.net/#raku) Freenode channel and say Hello!

If you prefer email, head over to the [mailing lists](https://raku.org/archive/lists/).
The [perl6-users mailing list](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/) is the one you
probably want to use.


## Contact the Perl community

Here's a list of [Perl mailing lists](https://lists.perl.org/), with
[this Perl specific list for beginners](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.beginners/).
Perl has its own IRC hosting site, with [this list of channels](http://www.irc.perl.org/channels.html).
`#perl-help` is the best place for beginners.
